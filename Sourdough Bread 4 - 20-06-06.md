9:00-9:20
Levain (400g):
75g whole wheat flour
10g corn flour
75g white flour
160g water
80g starter (24hr fed)
- 1:00 delay

11:40-11:50
Initial dough mix:
1222g white flour
882g water
- 1:40 delay
Mix ingredients until all the flour is incorporated into the bulk of dough, then perform a series of stretching exercises on the dough for 2-3 min
- To get an even stronger dough before the bulk fermentation begins, next time try placing the initial dough mix 1:40 before the final dough mix (1:50 after the end of levain mix) and schedule a series of stretches and folds 30 min before the final dough mix (3:00 after the end of levain mix). This way, as the fermentation has not yet begun, we're not afraid of losing the fermentation gas inside the dough and could perform stretches and folds more vigorously, more abundantly, and perhaps more effectively. We might kick-start the bulk fermentation with a stronger dough with less need for stretches and folds during the bulk fermentation, trap more gas during the initial stages of the fermentation and avoid losing it while exercising the dough. Perhaps one or two sets - one immediately after the initial dough mix and another 30 min later - could give us enough strength. If the strength is still not enough 30 min after the final dough mix, schedule more sets of stretch and fold 20 min apart.

12:50-13:00
Final dough mix (75% hydrated) and initial stretch and fold
2104g autolysed dough
24g salt
271g levain
- 1:10 delay
- The levain is at its highest 3:30 after the mix. Next time schedule the final dough mix 3:30 hours after the end of the levain mix.

13:00-17:00
Bulk fermentation, cover the bowl, 25 deg C (we don't have a thermometer)
13:20 stretch & fold (wet hands) at 4 sides, cover with damp cloth
13:40 stretch & fold, cover
14:00 stretch & fold, cover
At this point, if the dough hasn't got enough strength, schedule another set of stretch and fold (one or more times as needed) every 20 minutes.
Method:
Place a small bowl of water at hand to wet the hands and the bowl scraper as needed so the dough doesn't stick to them. Using the bowl scraper, detach the top portion of the dough from the bowl, then, while hoding the bowl with one hand and using the other hand, quickly lift the top portion so the dough is stretched and fold it over the bottom portion. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Proceed with two more turns so the bowl comes back after a whole 360 degrees. Later stretch and folds must be ever gentler not to disturb the gas that is already built up inside the dough too much.
Alternative method of stretch and fold:  From the right and left of the bowl, shove the wet hands underneath the dough and gently lift the middle part so that the top and bottom sides hang. Lift further so the hanging sides stretch enough. Then place the dough back so that one of the hanging sides now lies on the other and the dough is folded. Turn the bowl so that what was the left and right sides of the dough will now be the top and bottom sides (the dough will turn 90 degrees). Repeat the lift, stretch, fold, turn procedure (another 90 degree). Lift, stretch, fold, and turn two more times so that the whole 360 degree is covered.

17:00
Divide & preshape 6 x 400g rounds, prepare glaze

Preheat the oven for the barbari at 250C with the water dish inside. Use a wide and flat oven friendly dish (something like a pizza pan) so enough steam is generated.

Prepare the work surface:
Probably a table top horizontally divided into three sections. The leftmost section is where the bulk is placed (top) along with with scale (bottom left) and a bowl of water (bottom right, for wetting the bench knife and the hand as needed). Also, perhaps try not dumping the whole bulk on the table so it doesn't spread (as it is quite wet) to occupy so much space. Just grab a piece from inside the mixing container using a wet hand and the bench knife. Place the piece on the floured scale and adjust the weight. Then place the dough in the middle section of the table. The middle section is the shaping area where the shaping techniques are performed (folding sides, rotating, skin building, etc). While performing the techniques, slightly wet the hand and the bench knife if the dough starts sticking to them. The middle section must NOT be floured - the wetness from the hand and the bench knife will keep the skin of the dough wet and prevent it from sticking to the surface much. After shaping the dough, lift it using the bench knife and place it in the rightmost section of the table. The right section is floured beforehand and is where the preshaped dough rounds are placed. Allow enough space between them because they might spread (as they are highly hydrated).

After placing each round on the middle section, grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back over the top. With both hands (or with the bench knife in turns), stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it. Then stretch and fold the top over it to form an envelope shape with a seam on the top. Pinch the top to seal the seam. Then flip the dough over (with the bench knife) to get the seam side down. Now rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension on the skin.
The shaping trick for the wet dough is to use the bench knife to shovel underneath the dough (south), push it away while rotating it about 180 degrees around the vertical axis, then pull the round using the bench knife towards yourself. Once the dough comes back to its starting point, pull the bench knife off the back. Using two fingers hold the dough right above the bench knife so that pulling the knife out doesn't strech out the dough. With this technique the bench knife keeps the contact point of the dough with the surface from rising up. With the back side held down and the front side rolling in, the dough skin on the top has to stretch and tension is built up.
When enough tension is built on the surface, lift the dough off with the bench knife and place it on a floured surface with the seam side still down (bench)
Don't flour boule tops.
- Of the 2.4 kg dough that was prepared, 5 of them were roughly 400g and the last one was 336g. Next time, make 2470g dough for 6 x 400g dough rounds.
- 1:20 delay

Prepare barbari glaze (ferni):
20g whole wheat flour
100g hot (near boil) water
Pour the boiling water into a small pan placed on the stove, then add the flour little by little while stirring the mixture to prevent formation of clots. Stop adding flour when the desired thickness is achieved.
- Optimal rate of ferni seems to be 625% hydrated mixture prepared according to the same instructions. Amount of ferni to prepare relative to total amount of flour in the bulk is 8.7%.
- Next time, perhaps use the same amount of milk instead of water. Pour the milk into a small pan, bring it to near boil temperature, then gradually add the flour.
- 1:20 delay

17:30 Shape
Preshaping of multiple dough rounds takes some time and, by the time that the last dough has been preshaped, the first preshaped dough has already rested for about 20 minutes and is ready to be shaped. Therefore, start shaping the first dough 30 min after its preshape has been done.
Grease the surface of the peel and its sides as the dough will spread and spill over the sides and will stick if they're not well greased.
Flip the round seam side up, wet the hands and the bench knife, grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back on top. Use the bench knife for folding if the dough can't be held between fingers as it's so much hydrated.
With both hands (or with the bench knife in turns), stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top to form an envelope shape 
Rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension just like the preshape step.
Lift the dough using the bench knife and place it on the peel seam side down. Then flatten the dough to cover the width of the peel. A very small portion of the flattened dough should be sticking out of the right side of the peel.
- 1:20 delay
- Next time, 20 min after the round is preshaped, if it lacks enough strength, perform the tension building techniques and put it back to rest. Otherwise, flour the middle section of the table, then lift the dough and put it there seam side down. Flatten it there to make almost half the length of the final loaf (15 cm). Generously flour the spot off which you lifted the dough and put the flattened dough there. Then immediately glaze and punch the barbari pattern. When it comes to baking the loaf, place the peel on the table, lift the flat dough off with both hands and extend it longitudinally to the full size of the loaf (30 cm) and place it on the peel floured side down. Then place it in the oven by sliding it in. No need to flour the oven tray beforehand.

18:00 Bake
Carve the top of the flattened dough on the peel with the barbari pattern using fingers held together.
Glaze the top with the brush.
- To carve the barbari pattern with the fingers needs wetting the fingers so the dough doesn't stick to them. This adds extra moisture to the crust. It's better to glaze the top to before putting the pattern to avoid the need for wetting the fingers.
Pull the tray out
Cover the oven tray surface with white flour. 
Bring the peel above the baking tray, then place the small side of the dough that is sticking out on the right side of the baking tray, then move the peel to the other side while raising the other side of the peel to turn it slowly over as you move it to the other side so the dough is evenly stretched to cover the length of the baking tray.
Immediately lower the temperature to 225 at this point.
At this point also start shaping the next barbari dough and placing it on the peel.

18:10 turn the bread 180 degrees around the vertical axis to make up for the uneven heat distibution inside the oven.

18:20 Take the bread out and proceed with the baking of the next dough that is shaped already and rested on the peel for almost 15 minutes.

- The glaze serves the purpose of keeping the crust from hardening before the bread goes through oven spring during the first 10 minutes of the bake. The water dish inside the oven is useless and an inconvenience too. At about 15 minutes through the bake rotate the bread to bake the crust evenly despite unevenness of the oven heat.

- New schedule for shaping and baking multiple rounds with a single oven:
min 0-5: start shaping round 1
5-18: round 1 peel rest
18-20: round 1 glaze, pattern, place in the oven
20-25: start shaping round 2
25-38: round 2 peel rest
35: turn round 1 in the oven for even baking
38-40: round 2 glaze, pattern, take round 1 out of the oven, place round 2 in the oven
40-45: start shaping round 3
45-58: round 3 peel rest
55: turn round 2 in the oven for even baking
58-60: round 3 glaze, pattern, take round 2 out of the oven, place round 3 in the oven
...
Every 20 min cycle, the next loaf rests on the peel while the current loaf is being baked in the oven. Shaping and baking 6 loaves should take about 140 min.

- After baking, each 400g dough round (75% hydrated) yields a 310g loaf. Each loaf mass is 77% of initial dough mass. 52% of the water content of the dough is evaporated. Each loaf is 26% made up of water.
