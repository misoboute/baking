# Sourdough Doughnut

## Dough ingredients
- 60g 100% hydrated levain
- 170g (3/4 cup) lukewarm milk (scalded then cooled)
- 50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar
- 2.5g (1/2 teaspoon) salt
- 1 egg (50g)
- 31g (1/6 cup) solid vegetable shortening
- 270g (2 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
- vegetable oil, for frying

### Observations
Next time, perhaps try replacing the shortening with 42 grams of butter. Expect a wetter dough.

## Preparations
Half an hour before the levain is expected to be at its highest, prepare the ingredients. Heat the milk and let it cool down for 20 min. 

## Mix the dough
When the levain is at its highest rise, pour it into a bowl and add the milk, sugar, salt, egg, shortening, and 1 cup of the flour. Stir in the remaining flour by hand until the dough is smooth.

## Bulk rise
Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size for about 4.5 hours.

### Observations
It doesn't double in size. At best it comes to 1.5 times its initial size.

## Shape + final rise
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Flour the top of the bulk and shape using hands and/or the bench knife into an almost round ball. Pat it flat into a rounded rectangle almost 2cm thick. Cut the dough into 12 equally sized squares using the bench knife. This way, you won't have doughnut holes or the excess dough skeleton. Cut and lift each piece and place on separate small baking sheets on the bench to rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 3 hours.

### Observations
It doesn't double in size. At best it comes to 1.5 times its initial size.

## Prepare the filling
While the doughnuts are rising, make the filling. My favourite filling for these doughnuts is [Ferni.md](Ferni.md). You can make more ferni than is needed for the doughnuts and keep the rest for breakfast.

## Fry
When the doughnuts have risen, heat the vegetable oil to 175 deg C in a deep fryer or Dutch oven. Carefully slide the dough into the hot oil. Dip your spider or slotted spoon in the oil, then turn each slice of dough over the spoon and slide it into the pan. Turn the doughnuts as they brown, they should cook for about 1 minute per side. Do this in batches as needed making sure to keep the oil at 175 deg C.

Carefully remove the browned doughnuts from the oil with the spoon. Set on a rack to drain.

When the doughnuts are cool, using a sharp, narrow knife, carefully create a pocket inside the doughnut to hold the filling. The opening to the pocket should be as small as possible (so the filling won't leak out).

Fill a pastry bag with a plain tip with the filling. Insert the tip into the hole of the doughnut and gently, but generously, fill with the cream filling. Dust the filled doughnuts with additional confectioners' sugar.
