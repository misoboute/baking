9:40-10:00
Levain (400g):
75g whole wheat flour
10g corn flour
75g white flour
160g water
80g starter (24hr fed)

13:00
Initial dough mix:
823g white flour
594g water
- Did the initial dough mix at 13:30 and autolysis started at 13:40. By this time, the levain has come to its full bloom and is beginning to deflate. Should have started autolysis at 12:30 so must have started the initial dough mix at about 12:20

13:20-14:20 autolysis
- 13:40-14:40

14:40
Final dough mix: 75% hydrated 
1417g autolysed dough
16g sea salt
183g levain
- by this time the levain has lost some of its gas, should have started autolysis earlier - 3:30 to 4 hours after levain mix.

15:00-19:00
Bulk fermentation, cover the bowl, 25 deg C (we don't have a thermometer)
- Still no thermometer, at 15:00
15:30 stretch & fold (wet hands) at 4 sides, cover with damp cloth
16:00 fold, cover
16:30 fold, cover
- Alternative method of stretch and fold: place a small bowl of water to wet the hands as needed so the dough doesn't stick to them. From the right and left of the bowl, shove the wet hands underneath the dough and gently lift the middle part so that the top and bottom sides hang. Lift further so the hanging sides stretch enough. Then place the dough back so that one of the hanging sides now lies on the other and the dough is folded. Turn the bowl so that what was the left and right sides of the dough will now be the top and bottom sides (the dough will turn 90 degrees). Repeat the lift, stretch, fold, turn procedure (another 90 degree). Lift, stretch, fold, and turn two more times so that the whole 360 degree is covered.
  
19:00
Divide & preshape: 4 x 400g balls
Flour the surface
Dump the dough out using dough spatula
Flour the top of the bulk
Divide using bench knife and put on the scale, add or subtract to adjust weight 
- Started at 19:20 because the bulk hadn't risen enough. Maybe the stretch and fold were too harsh. 

Grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back over the top
With both hands, stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top over it to form an envelope shape with a seam
Then flip the dough over (with the bench knife) to get the seam side down.
With both hands rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension (or use bench knife and floured hand), turn and pull toward you, build tension on the skin.
The shaping trick is to use one hand or the bench knife to shovel underneath the dough, push it away while rotating it a little around the vertical axis, then cup both hands or the bench knife and the other hand behind the dough so that the contact point of the dough with the surface is kept from rising up, and pull while rolling the dough towards yourself. With the back side held down and the front side rolling in, the dough skin on the top has to stretch and tension is built up.
Then lift the dough off with the bench knife and place it on a floured surface with the seam side down (bench)
Don't flour boule tops.
- Needed more space. Probably a table top horizontally divided into three sections. The leftmost section is where the bulk is placed (top) along with with scale (bottom left) and a bowl of water (bottom right, for wetting the bench knife and the hand as needed). Also, next time, perhaps try not dumping the whole bulk on the table so it doesn't spread (as it is quite wet) to occupy so much space. Just grab a piece from inside the mixing bowl using a wet hand and the bench knife. Place the piece on the floured scale and adjust the weight. Then place the dough in the middle section of the table. The middle section is the shaping area where the shaping techniques are performed (folding sides, rotating, skin building, etc). While performing the techniques, slightly wet the hand and the bench knife if the dough starts sticking to them. The middle section must not be floured - the wetness from the hand and the bench knife will keep the skin of the dough wet and prevent it from sticking to the surface much. After shaping the dough, lift it using the bench knife and place it in the rightmost section of the table. The right section is floured beforehand and is where the preshaped doughs are placed. Allow enough space between them because they might spread (as they are highly hydrated).

19:20-19:50 bench rest covered with damp towel
Prepare barbari glaze (ferni):
18g whole wheat flour
42g hot (near boil) water
Pour the water in a small pan and add the flour little by little while mixing well before adding every bit so clots aren't formed.
- Next time use a thinner glaze like a 500% hydrated ferni. Pour the boiling water into a small pan placed on the stove, then add the flour little by little while stirring the mixture to prevent formation of clots. Stop adding flour when the desired thickness is achieved.

19:50 Shape
- Preshaping of multiple dough rounds takes some time and, by the time that the last dough has been preshaped, the first preshaped dough has already rested for about 20 minutes and is ready to be shaped. Therefore, start shaping the first dough, 20 min after its preshape has been done.  Preheating must begin right before preshaping.
Preheat the oven for the barbari at 250C with the water dish inside.
Grease the surface of the peel with whole wheat flour, for the other two cover with whole wheat flour.
- Grease not just the surface of the peel but the sides also, as the dough will spread and spill over the sides and will stick if they're not well greased.
Flip the round floured side down (seam side up), wet the hands and the bench knife, grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back on top. Use the bench knife for folding if the dough can't be held between fingers as it's so much hydrated.
With both hands (or with the bench knife in turns), stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top to form an envelope shape 
Rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension just like the preshape step.
Lift the dough using the bench knife and place it on the peel. Then flatten the dough to cover the width of the peel.
In both cases a very small portion of the flattened dough should be sticking out of the right side of the peel.
Cover the oven tray surface with whole wheat flour. 

20:30 Bake the barbari
Carve the top of the flattened dough on the peel with the barbari pattern using fingers held together.
Glaze the top with the brush.
Pull the tray out
Cover the tray with whole wheat flour.
Bring the peel above the baking tray, then place the small side of the dough that is sticking out on the right side of the baking tray, then move the peel to the other side so the dough is evenly stretched to cover the length of the baking tray.
Immediately lower the temperature to 225 at this point.
At this point also start shaping the next barbari dough and placing it on the peel.

20:40 Take the water dish out

20:50 Barbari should be ready

22:30 Preheat the oven at 250 C with the tray and the water dish

23:00
Flour the boule seam side (top), flip it over the baking tray, score, put in the oven, put the lid on (or keep the water dish inside)
(next time remember to lower the temperature to 250 at this point)

23:00-23:25 Steam baking (8:40-9:10)

23:25 remove the lid (or take the water dish out)

23:25-23:35 Crust baking

(The water dish worked perfectly)
