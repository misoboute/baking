# Ferni

## Description
Ferni AKA Kheer is a creamy, paste-textured, sweet sort of pastry that is popular in the middle-east, Asia minor, and the Indian subcontinent. As such, you'll find myriad varieties of it with different ingredients and recipes. The core ingredients of ferni are water, milk, sugar, and a starchy cereal or flour such as rice, rice flour, corn flour, wheat flour, etc. Some recipes make use of cornstarch alone. This one here is my ideal choice for filling doughnuts but it can also consumed as a perfect breakfast meal. If you like, you can put jam or honey on top of it if you want to serve it as breakfast or just serve it as it is.

## Ingredients
- 240g flour
- 240g water
- 1.5L milk
- 120g sugar
- 1/2 tsp saffron
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 100g crushed nuts (almond, pistachio, etc) for dressing the top

## Instructions
Pour the water in a pan and place it on the stove and turn it on to medium heat. Then add sugar and stir until dissolved. Add milk, cinnamon, and saffron next and mix well. Pour the flour in a sift and hold on top of the pan. Pour the flour into the mixture gradually and bit by bit so that it doesn't form clots. After you pour each tiny bit of flour, stir to evenly mix it in and then add the next bit. Continue until all the flour is gone. Don't stop stirring the mixture meanwhile. When all the flour is gone, keep stirring on the heat until the mixture becomes thicker and like a runny paste. When the desired thickness and texture is achieved, remove from the heat and continue stirring for another minute. The ferni is ready. Pour the ferni into four soup plates and let them cool down in the kitchen. Then dress the top with crushed nuts and optionally more cinnamon.

## Notes
If you're using the ferni for doughnut filling, you won't need to pour it into soup plates. Just let it cool down and then store it in the fridge to be used later for filling.
