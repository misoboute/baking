# Doogh

## Description
Doogh is a traditional Persian fermented dairy drink that is pleasantly fizzy and sour. It is similar to the Turkish ayran and kefir. In this recipe I describe the experiments that I have done and the results that I have come up with. I don't know of any other recipes that use this fermentation method. I have found many recipes for doogh which all result in an unsavory white drink. That is not to my taste and besides none of them are the authentic doogh which is both _fizzy_ and _sour_. If you try this recipe, I bet you'll never take interest in those others which are, by the way, ridiculously simple! Most of them just mix yoghurt, water, salt, and dried peppermint leaves and that's it! No fermentation, nothing! Here you'll find my experimental take at discovering the original recipe. To use this recipe, you need a _[sourdoogh starter batch](Sourdoogh-Starter.md)_. Take a look there if you don't already have it.

## Ingredients
700g yoghurt (50%)
70g starter (5%)
630g water (45%)
1.75 tsp salt
1 tsp ground peppermint leaves

## Yield
1.4kg ~ 1.5L doogh

## Instructions
Mix all the ingredients and pour into an air-tight container and let it rest for two days in a warm place. Then bottle it up and store in the fridge.

I usually pour the mixed ingredients into an airtight bottle and place it in a warm place for two days and then just transfer the bottle to the fridge.
