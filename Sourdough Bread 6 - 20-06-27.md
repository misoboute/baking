# Sourdough Barbari Bread 6

## Levain mix
Time: 9:00-9:30

### Ingredients
- 248g flour (45% whole wheat, 45% all-purpose, 10% corn)
- 248g water
- 558g starter (24hr fed)

### Comments
This step is essentially the same as feeding the starter - except here we feed the starter to get a much more amount of it. So if I usually keep a 150g starter batch, here I will feed such that I get much more of it. When the starter/levain is at its highest rise, a portion of it will be used in the dough mix and the rest will be kept as the starter for the next time to bake.

As we use a mixture of different flours for feeding the starter/levain and we use the same mixture every time, I keep a store of premixed flour (calling it the starter feed), and use it when feeding the starter (mixing the levain).

These ingredients will produce 550g of 10% seeded, 100% hydrated levain. Only 288g of it is needed for the dough. Of the remaining 262g, at least 150g should be kept as the starter for future. So we have 112g of excess levain that we could use for making doughnuts, etc. 

Before making the levain (or feeding the starter), if the starter has liquid on top of it (hooch/vinegar), mix it well before using it. Then, in a mixing bowl, pour the water and add the appropriate amount of the starter and mix well. Then add the flour and mix well. 

There is also the option to use a 20% seeded levain which rises to full bloom at about 3:30 hr after the mix. 10% seeded levain takes about 4-4:15 hour to rise to full bloom. This can be useful for adjusting the schedule. To know when the levain is at its highest, pour the levain into a tall glass jar with at least twice space to hold the initial levain mix (it won't rise to more than twice its initial volume). Throughout the next few hours, the levain will keep rising up to a maximum. At that point it will start falling and leaving a residue mark on the jar that is visible from the outside. Keep watching the levain throughout this time. The levain is ready as soon as the tide mark appears on the jar meaning that it has risen to its highest and is beginning to subside. To make sure that the levain is ready, drop a spoonful of it into a glass of water. If it floats on top of the water, it's good enough for mixing into the dough.

## Initial dough mix
Time: 11:40-12:00

### Ingredients
- 1298g all-purpose flour
- 938g water

### Comments
Mix ingredients until all the flour is incorporated into the bulk of dough, then perform a series of stretching exercises on the dough for 2-3 min.

To get an even stronger dough before the bulk fermentation begins, start the initial dough mix 1:50 before the final dough mix (2:20 after the end of levain mix) and schedule a series of stretches and folds 30 min before the final dough mix (3:30 after the end of levain mix). This way, as the fermentation has not yet begun, we're not afraid of losing the fermentation gas inside the dough and could perform stretches and folds more vigorously, more abundantly, and perhaps more effectively. We might kick-start the bulk fermentation with a stronger dough with less need for stretches and folds during the bulk fermentation, trap more gas during the initial stages of the fermentation and avoid losing it while exercising the dough. Perhaps one or two sets - one immediately after the initial dough mix and another 30 min later - could give us enough strength. If the strength is still not enough 30 min after the final dough mix, schedule more sets of stretch and fold 20 min apart.

### Stretch and fold method
Place a small bowl of water at hand to wet the hands as needed so the dough doesn't stick to them. Using one hand, detach the top portion of the dough from the bowl, then, while holding the bowl with one hand and using the other hand, quickly lift the top portion, so the dough is stretched, and fold it over the bottom portion. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Proceed with two more turns so the bowl comes back after a whole 360 degrees. Later stretch and folds (during the bulk fermentation) must be ever gentler not to disturb the gas that is already built up inside the dough too much.

### Alternative method of stretch and fold
From the right and left of the bowl, shove the wet hands underneath the dough and gently lift the middle part so that the top and bottom sides hang. Lift further so the hanging sides stretch enough. Then place the dough back so that one of the hanging sides now lies on the other and the dough is folded. Turn the bowl so that what was the left and right sides of the dough will now be the top and bottom sides (the dough will turn 90 degrees). Repeat the lift, stretch, fold, turn procedure (another 90 degree). Lift, stretch, fold, and turn two more times so that the whole 360 degree is covered.

### Observations
- For mixing the dough, I poured all the water in the bowl and then added all the flour and started mixing with hand.

## Autolyse
Time: 12:00-13:30

13:00 one set of stretch and fold

### Observations
- 1:40 delay

## Final dough mix
Time: 13:30-13:50

### Ingredients
- 2236g autolysed dough
- 26g salt
- 288g levain

### Comments
This will produce 2550g of 75% hydrated, 10% seeded dough

Measure and pour the levain into a bowl, then add the salt to it. Mix well to dissolve the salt in the levain water. Then pour the levain mixture into the autolysed dough and exercise with hands to mix evenly.

For 6 x 400g dough rounds, we prepare 150g of extra dough to compensate for the dough measurement errors and the leftover dough sticking to the bowl, etc.

Use a transparent (glass or plastic) container for mixing so that the rising progress of the bulk could be tracked.

## Bulk fermentation
Time: 13:50-18:10

## Comments
Cover the bowl with damp towel, 25 deg C (we don't have a thermometer)
- 14:20 one set of stretch & fold, cover

Before performing the first set of stretches and folds, just as the dough surface is flat, mark the level of the dough on the exterior of the container (by sticking a thin, line-like piece of dough) so you can see, at any time during the bulk rise, how much the dough has risen.

At this point, if the dough hasn't got enough strength, schedule another set of stretch and fold (one or more times as needed) every 30 minutes.

Before every scheduled set of stretch and fold, perform the window pane test to see if the dough has achieved enough strength already or it needs more stretching and folding.

### Window pane test
Pinch two points of the dough almost 10cm apart and stretch between the fingers. The dough should be stretched like cling wrap around the fingers to make a very thin, almost transparent window pane. If the dough is not yet strong enough, it will tear before the window pane is formed.

## Preshape
Time: 18:10

### Comments
Prepare the work surface, divide and preshape 6 x 400g rounds, and then prepare the glaze (ferni)

Preheat the oven for the barbari at 250C.

### Work surface
Probably a table top horizontally divided into four sections. The leftmost section is where the bulk is placed (top) along with with scale (bottom left) and a bowl of water (bottom right, for wetting the bench knife and the hand as needed). Also, perhaps try not dumping the whole bulk on the table so it doesn't spread (as it is quite wet) to occupy so much space. Just grab a piece from inside the mixing container using a wet hand and cut it off using the bench knife. Place the piece on the floured scale and adjust the weight. Then place the dough in the middle section of the table.

The middle section is the shaping area where the shaping techniques are performed (folding sides, rotating, skin building, etc). While performing the techniques, slightly wet the hand and the bench knife if the dough starts sticking to them. The middle section must NOT be floured - the wetness from the hand and the bench knife will keep the skin of the dough wet and prevent it from sticking to the surface too much. After shaping the dough, lift it using the wet bench knife and place it in the rightmost section of the table.

The right section is floured (using whole wheat flour) beforehand and is where the preshaped dough rounds are placed. Allow enough space between them because they might spread (as they are highly hydrated).

If the right section of the table (bench) doesn't have enough room to hold all the rounds, (as they are sparsely placed), preshape, shape, and bake 6 rounds first (or as many as you have room for). As soon as the first loaf goes into the oven and a spot on the bench becomes available, divide and preshape the another round. Remember to shape each round about at least 30 min after its preshape.

### Preshaping method
After placing each round on the middle section, grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back over the top. With both hands (or with the bench knife in turns), stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it. Then stretch and fold the top over it to form an envelope shape with a seam on the top. Pinch the top to seal the seam. Then flip the dough over (with the bench knife) to get the seam side down. Now rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension on the skin.

The shaping trick for the wet dough is to use the bench knife to shovel underneath the dough (south), push it away while rotating it about 180 degrees around the vertical axis, then pull the round using the bench knife towards yourself. Once the dough comes back to its starting point, pull the bench knife off the back. Using two fingers hold the dough right above the bench knife so that pulling the knife out doesn't strech out the dough. With this technique the bench knife keeps the contact point of the dough with the surface from rising up. With the back side held down and the front side rolling in, the dough skin on the top has to stretch and tension is built up.

When enough tension is built on the surface, lift the dough off with the bench knife and place it on a floured surface on the right side with the seam side still down (bench rest).
Don't flour round tops.

### Barbari glaze (ferni)

#### Ingredients
- 26g equal parts whole wheat flour and cornmeal
- 129g water

#### Method
Bring the water in a small pan on the stove to just near the boiling temperature, then add the flour little by little while stirring the mixture to prevent formation of clots. Stop adding flour when the desired thickness is achieved.

Cornmeal is expected to contribute a starchy and sugary finish to the crust while the whole wheat flour provides the nutrients, the rich flavour, and the texture of the crust.

Optimal rate of ferni seems to be 625% hydrated mixture prepared according to the same instructions. Amount of ferni to prepare relative to total amount of flour in the bulk is 8.7%. 625% hydration requires 21g flour per 129g liquid. The extra 5g should be kept at the ready for adjusting the thickness of the ferni.

### Observations

## Shape
Time: 18:40

### Comments
Preshaping of multiple dough rounds and preparing the ferni takes some time and, by the time that the last dough has been preshaped, the first preshaped dough has already rested on the bench for about 30 minutes and is ready to be shaped. Therefore, start shaping the first dough 20-30 min after its preshape has been done.

30 min after the round is preshaped, if it lacks enough strength, perform the tension building techniques. For 400g rounds, if the center of the round is less than 4-5cm thick, I'd say it needs more strength. For performing the tension building techniques, without lifting the round off the bench, perform the folds to make the envelope package, then lift the package off the bench and place it in the shaping area seam side down. Then rotate using the bench knife and the hand. Then generously flour its spot on the bench and lift it off the shaping area and place it back on the bench seam side down. Using wet hands, flatten it there to make a rounded square that can be held by the palms of both hands held together (almost 10cm x 10cm).

## Bake
Time: 19:10

### Comments
The first round to have been shaped should be baked first. Glaze with ferni and punch the barbari pattern. Punching in the barbari pattern with the fingers needs wetting the fingers so the dough doesn't stick to them. This adds extra moisture to the crust. It's better to glaze the top before putting the pattern to avoid the need for wetting the fingers. Glazing and patterning should be done right before baking (not right after shaping) because the pattern begins to dissappear and the glaze dries up the more that the shaped dough rests.

Place the peel near the bench and flour generously with whole wheat flour or milled bran. Then lift the flattened dough off with both hands and extend it longitudinally to the full size of the loaf (30 cm) while maintaining its width and place it on the peel floured side down. Bring the peel near the oven and pull the oven tray out. Then place it in the oven by sliding it in. No need to flour the oven tray beforehand. Before preshaping another round on the table and the tension building exercises, remember to remove the flour off the bottom middle section using the bench knife.

At this point also start shaping the next barbari dough that has rested on the bench for more than 20 min and, if there is more dough in the bulk that is not preshaped, preshape another dough round.

19:20 turn the bread 180 degrees around the vertical axis to make up for the uneven heat distibution inside the oven.

19:25 Take the bread out and proceed with the baking of the next dough that is shaped already and rested on the peel for almost 15 minutes.

As the dough is not too thick, 10-15 min might be enough for each loaf. Keep an eye on the oven. As soon as the crust on one side of the loaf becomes golden, it's time to turn it around and it will be ready about 3-5 min after that.

The glaze serves the purpose of keeping the crust from hardening before the bread goes through oven spring during the first 10 minutes of the bake. Placing a water dish inside the oven is useless and an inconvenience too.
