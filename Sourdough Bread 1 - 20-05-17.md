00:00 (18:00)
Levain (250g):
50g whole wheat flour
50g white flour
100g water
50g starter (24hr fed)

4:00 (23:00)
Initial dough mix (autolyse):
550g white flour
332g water

5:00 (0:10)
Final dough mix: 69% hydrated 
850g autolysed dough
10g sea salt
30g water
110g levain 

5:10-9:10 (0:10-4:10)
Bulk fermentation, cover the bowl, 25 deg C
5:40 stretch&fold (wet hands) at 4 sides, cover (0:40)
6:10 fold, cover (1:10)
6:40 fold, cover (1:40)

9:15 (4:10)
Divide & preshape:
Dump the dough out using dough spatula (used rice spoon)
Flour the top of the bulk (didn't)
Divide using bench knife (used rice spoon instead of bench knife)
For each one:
Grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back over the top
With both hands, stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top over it to form an envelope shape with a seam
The flip the dough over to get the seam side down
With both hands rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension (or use bench knife and floured hand, turn and pull toward you, build tension on the skin)
(I tried to use the rice spoon instead of the bench knife, didn't work, used hands, the dough stuck to the surface and on my hands constantly, so I put in a lot of, maybe too much, flour, it ended up like a cow pie! the mistake was I'd forgotten to flour the dough top before flipping it over also used hands for lifting it up which stuck to my hands. Also I should have used a bench knife for lifting the dough, so it wouldn't stick to my fingers. And the shaping trick is to use one hand or the bench knife to shovel underneath the dough, push it away while rotating it a little around the vertical axis, then cup both hands or the bench knife and the other hand behind the dough so that the contact point of the dough with the surface is kept from rising up, and pull the dough towards yourself. With the back side held down and the front side rollin in, the dough skin from the top has to stretch and tension is built up)
Then lift the dough off and place it on a floured surface (bench)

9:30-10:00 bench rest, uncovered (4:30-5:00)

10:00 Shape (5:00)
Flour the surface, flour boule top, flip boule floured side down (seam side up), flour hands
Grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back on top
With both hands, stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top to form an envelope shape 
With both hands rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension
All like the preshape step
Flour the proofing basket generously and put the boule in seam side up

10:15-13:15 second rise, cover the basket (5:15-8:30)

13:00 Preheat oven with the water dish inside (8:00)

13:15 (8:30)
Flour the boule seam side, flip it over the baking tray, score, put in the oven, put the lid (or keep the water dish inside)
(when I flipped the dough into the tray, the edges were stuck to the basket lining cloth because it was damp and had dampened the dusting on its surface. the rise was good. the dough wasn't strong enough so I did another shaping. but I made a mistake here: I started shaping with the seam side down so, rather than strengthening the existing skin, I buried it inside and turned the former seam side into its new top. then the shaping was excessive so the surface kind of cracked.)

13:15-13:40 Steam baking (8:40-9:10)

13:40 remove the lid (or take the water dish out)

13:40-14:00 Crust baking

(The water dish worked perfectly)
