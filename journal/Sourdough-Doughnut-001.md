# Sourdough Doughnut

## Dough ingredients
- 60g 100% hydrated levain
- 170g (3/4 cup) lukewarm milk (scalded then cooled)
- 50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar
- 2.5g (1/2 teaspoon) salt
- 1 egg (50g)
- 31g (1/6 cup) solid vegetable shortening
- 270g (2 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
- vegetable oil, for frying

Half an hour before the levain is expected to be at its highest, prepare the ingredients. Heat the milk and let it cool down for 20 min. 

When the levain is at its highest rise, pour it into a bowl and add the milk, sugar, salt, egg, shortening, and 1 cup of the flour. Stir in the remaining flour by hand until the dough is smooth.

Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size for about 4.5 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Pat it flat then roll it out with a rolling pin until it is 2cm thick. Cut the dough with round cookie cutters. Grease the cookie cutter to prevent the dough from sticking. If you don't have a cookie cutter, dip the rim of a glass in some oil and use it as your cookie cutter. Place the cutouts, evenly spaced, on floured baking sheets and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in size for about 3 hours.

While the doughnuts are rising, make the filling. I have placed directions for the filling in a separate file [Ferni.md](Ferni.md). You can make more ferni than is needed for the doughnuts and keep the rest for breakfast.

When the doughnuts have risen, heat the vegetable oil to 175 deg C in a deep fryer or Dutch oven. Carefully slide the dough into the hot oil. Turn the doughnuts as they brown, they should cook for about 1 minute per side. Do this in batches as needed making sure to keep the oil at 175 deg C.

Carefully remove the browned doughnuts from the oil with a spider or slotted metal spoon. Set on a rack to drain.

When the doughnuts are cool, using a sharp, narrow knife, carefully create a pocket inside the doughnut to hold the filling. The opening to the pocket should be as small as possible (so the filling won't leak out).

Fill a pastry bag with a plain tip with the filling. Insert the tip into the hole of the doughnut and gently, but generously, fill with the cream filling. Dust the filled doughnuts with additional confectioners' sugar.
