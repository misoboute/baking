9:10-9:30
Levain (250g):
40g whole wheat flour
10g corn flour
50g white flour
100g water
50g starter (24hr fed)

13:00
Initial dough mix:
535g white flour
360g water

13:20-14:20 autolysis

14:20
Final dough mix: 70% hydrated 
895g autolysed dough
10g sea salt
107g levain 

14:40-18:40
Bulk fermentation, cover the bowl, 25 deg C (we don't have a thermometer)
15:10 stretch&fold (wet hands) at 4 sides, cover
15:50 fold, cover
16:30 fold, cover

18:40 (18:55-19:15)
Divide & preshape:
Flour the surface
Dump the dough out using dough spatula
Flour the top of the bulk
Divide using bench knife and put on the scale, add or subtract to adjust weight

For the boule and the barbari:
Grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back over the top
With both hands, stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top over it to form an envelope shape with a seam
Then flip the dough over (with the bench knife) to get the seam side down
With both hands rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension (or use bench knife and floured hand, turn and pull toward you, build tension on the skin)
(Last time the mistake was I'd forgotten to flour the dough top before flipping it over. Also used hands for lifting it up which stuck to my hands. I should have used a bench knife for lifting the dough, so it wouldn't stick to my fingers. And the shaping trick is to use one hand or the bench knife to shovel underneath the dough, push it away while rotating it a little around the vertical axis, then cup both hands or the bench knife and the other hand behind the dough so that the contact point of the dough with the surface is kept from rising up, and pull while rolling the dough towards yourself. With the back side held down and the front side rolling in, the dough skin on the top has to stretch and tension is built up)
Then lift the dough off with the bench knife and place it on a floured surface with the seam side down (bench)
(floured top of the boules)

19:00-19:30 bench rest covered with damp towel
Barbari glaze:
18g whole wheat flour
42g hot (near boil) water
mix in a small pan well to make homogeneous

19:30 Shape (19:45-20:00)

For the boule:
Flour the surface, flour boule top, flip boule floured side down (seam side up), flour hands
Grab the bottom side, fold 2/3 way back on top
With both hands, stretch from left and right, fold the left over the centre, fold the right over it.
Stretch and fold the top to form an envelope shape 
With both hands rotate on the surface and pull toward you to build more tension
All like the preshape step
Flour the proofing basket and the boule top _generously_ and put it in, seam side up, and cover the seam side with flour

For the barbari:
Cover the surface with whole wheat flour
Flour both hands, lift the dough, strech it from both sides horizontally to double its length and place back on the foured surface
Carve the top with the barbari pattern using fingers held together
Glaze the top with the brush
(impossible to lift the spreaded dough and lay it in the tray while extending it to the shape of barbari. next time, place the shaped dough on a well floured movable surface, something like a tray or a serving plate)

20:00-23:00 second rise, cover the basket and barbari with a damp towel

20:30 Preheat oven for the barbari
Flour the oven tray
Preheat the oven with the tray and the water dish inside
(not enough steam, next time preheat for 30 min and boil the water before putting it in the oven)

20:50 Bake the barbari
Pull the tray out
Gently hold the dough by its two sides and lay it on the tray while streching it along the tray - careful with the hot oven!
(next time bring the tray holding the dough above the baking tray, then gently slide one side of it onto the side of the baking tray, then move the holding tray to the other side so the dough is stretched and placed on the baking tray)
(next time remember to lower the temperature to 250 at this point)

21:00 Take the water dish out

21:10 Barbari should be ready

22:40 Preheat the oven at 250 C with the tray and the water dish
(not enough steam, next time preheat for 30 min and boil the water before putting it in the oven)

23:00
Flour the boule seam side (top), flip it over the baking tray, score, put in the oven, put the lid on (or keep the water dish inside)
(next time remember to lower the temperature to 250 at this point)

23:00-23:25 Steam baking (8:40-9:10)

23:25 remove the lid (or take the water dish out)

23:25-23:35 Crust baking

(The water dish worked perfectly)
